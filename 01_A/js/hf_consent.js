"<p>Recently, some strange creatures have been found on a far away planet. These aliens, even though bizarre in appearance, exhibit some human features and engange in activities known to us. As these creatures were only discovered a short time ago, their names will sound strange to you. Do not worry about any unfamiliar words in the following experiment – you do not have to remember them!</p>"+
"<p>During the experiment, you will read sentences and will be asked to copy them on your keyboard.</p>"+
"<p>We will start with a warm-up for your fingers and then continue to our alien creatures."+
"<p>The slides of the experiment will contain the following elements:"+
"<ul><li style='list-style-type:square;'> some gibberish to warm-up your fingers</li>"+
"<li style='list-style-type:square;'> pictures and/or names of alien creatures</li>"+
"<li style='list-style-type:square;'> a short explanation of the situation</li>"+
"<li style='list-style-type:square;'> a prompt to copy a sentence into an allocated box</li>"+
"<li style='list-style-type:square;'> the answer box.</li></ul>"+ 
"<p>You may look at each slide as long as you think is needed.<span class='important'>Then please type the answer into the allocated box.</span>"+
"<p>Once you have finished the experiment, you will be awarded a small compensation. (Do we do that?)</p>"+
"<p>Again, do not be confused by the simplicity of the task. The experiment was designed for children and you are part of the control group.</p>"+
